ABSTRACT 
According to the Topology Configuration part in Section IV of the paper "Dataplane Based Fast Failover in SDN-Enabled Wide Area Measurement System of Smart Grid", a commonly used simplification to study the communication network feature is to regard the communication network topology and power grid topology as the same. 

If two buses are connected with a transformer but not a transmission link, in this work, we assume that the two buses are very close to each other, and the distance is set as 0.5km.

Instructions: 
1. The .vsd files are the computed Shortest Path Trees (SPT) for each IEEE test power system topology;

2. The .xlsx files are the source data of each IEEE test power system;

3. The TopologyGeneration.m file is a MATLAB script to read the .xlsx files and generate the corresponding communication network topologies for each IEEE test power system; the TopologyGeneration_1180.m file is used to combine ten IEEE 118-bus topologies together to generate a large system for comparison.

4. The .mat files are the communication network topology matrix generated by the .m MATLAB script file.
